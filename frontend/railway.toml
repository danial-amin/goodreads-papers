# Railway frontend service (root is 'frontend')
# Build: Dockerfile in this directory.
# Set VITE_API_URL in Railway Variables (dashboard) so it is baked into the frontend at build time.
#
# If you changed VITE_API_URL but the app still uses the old URL:
# 1. Redeploy with cache cleared: Dashboard → your frontend service → Deployments → ⋮ → Redeploy → enable "Clear build cache"
#    Or set variable NO_CACHE=1 and redeploy, or run: railway redeploy --force
# 2. After a clean build, logs will show: "==> VITE_API_URL (build-time, will be baked into frontend): '...'"
